# Minimum-Spanning-Tree-JAVA
A school assignment in which I simulated Prim's algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) given a graph file and a root  
  
Every line of your text file should be a single edge  
An edge consists of two vertices and a weight in this order: vertex1 vertex2 weight  
An example graph file is given as graph.in  
  
To use:  
Compile it in the holding directory with "javac MST.java"  
Then run with the parameters "java MST.java graph_file root"  
An example call: "java MST.java graph.in A"
